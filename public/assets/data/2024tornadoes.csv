Evidence that the center of the tornado was still out over water at this point was strong, given that the downed trees were facing toward the river in almost all instances from Milton eastward until Paradise Point along Highway 36 about 1 mile east of downtown Milton.||The center of the tornado finally came on shore at Paradise Point and was immediately at low-end EF-2 strength as several large campers and a motorhome were demolished. One tri-axle camper weighing well over 10,000 pounds was rolled and thrown over 100 yards to the ESE, with debris scattered much farther downstream. Just across Highway 36, a well-built single family residence sustained major roof damage as half of the structure was removed by the tornado. This was also rated at EF-2 strength with winds of 115 mph. Just east of that house, a semi trailer was rolled, a large barn was  completely collapsed and shifted, and nearly every tree was snapped in a grove. This was a notable uptick in intensity from areas to the west as snapped trees were more sporadic in those areas. This was more justification for the increase to EF-2. It was at this point that a clear northern portion of the tornado track became evident as downed trees along Highway 36 were laying in a SE direction, pointing inward toward the center of the circulation. It was unclear just how wide the tornado was as it crossed through Milton, since half of the funnel was out over water, however the tornado was around 500 yards wide (roughly a third of a mile) by the time it reached the Trimble/Carroll county line at North Spillman Lane. EF-1/EF-2 intensity remained here as a large span of telephone polls were snapped.",CSV,0,0,0

Additional EF-2 damage occurred when the tornado removed the entire roof of a large two-story home. The tornado continued its northeastward jog, leaving Cottonwood proper, and commenced to destroy a two-story Moose Lodge that was composed of cinder-blocks resulting in another instance of EF-2 damage. The most significant tree damage noted on this survey occurred when the tornado paralleled Dyers Road, thus snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant damage along this northeastward path occurred on September Road where a double-wide home was completely destroyed, and resulted in one fatality. As the tornado continued to move northeast to across Whitaker Road and Creek Church Road, EF-1 tree damage was noted. The tornado caused mainly EF-0 damage to softwood and hardwood trees along Green Frog Road and Ed Tolar Road. One last structural damage occurred to a single-family home where it caused significant roof damage before lifting near the Chattahoochee River.

MLCAPE was 1000 J/kg, and mid-level lapse rates were 6.5 C/km. A 70-90 kt mid-level jet was west of the Quad State. A strong capping inversion suppressed storm activity in the evening, but the strong lift and upper level diffluence won out early morning. Two lines of storms developed after midnight in Southeast Missouri. The first progressed through the I-64 corridor from 0100-0400 CST. The latter was a very potent thunderstorm line racing eastward early morning April 2nd. This line continued throughout the day all the way to West Virginia, being designated a derecho. For Southern Illinois, widespread wind damage occurred with this line, and sections of the line that took a north-south orientation had a much more favorable line-normal component of shear promoting QLCS tornado development. Seven tornadoes originated in Southern Illinois: 2 in Williamson County (EF-2 and EF-1), 1 in Saline County (EF-2), 3 in Gallatin County (all EF-1s), and 1 in White County (EF-2 with the EF-2 damage in Posey County Indiana).

The tornado initially uprooted and snapped several softwood and hardwood trees, along Hickshill Road and in addition, it damaged an outbuilding there. The tornado continued northeast, damaging more hardwood and softwood trees along Piano Road. The first structure to be impacted by this tornado was a double-wide manufactured home on the northern side of Piano Road. Additional softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along Danford Bay Road. Tree damage continued along Orchid Road, Damascus Church Road and Layton Road as the tornado continued to progress northeastward. An outbuilding was damaged along Orchid Road, and a single-family home suffered significant roof damage along Layton Road. The tornado then destroyed two ninety foot, seventy-year-old concrete silos. Damage was found along the entire length of Everett Road which was composed of the snapping and uprooting of trees, along with damage to an outbuilding and a mobile home succumbing to window damage. More trees were damaged along Heislar Road and Peanut Road as the tornado continued its northeastward trek. A single-family home on Peanut Road suffered significant roof damage. When the tornado reached Shiloh Church Loop, a single-family home suffered significant roof damage. The tornado continued to move northeast across Highway 2 where more softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted and snapped. Most of the damage to this point is classified as EF-1. Before the tornado crossed into Alabama, it damaged the roof of a small business on US-231. After crossing into Houston County Alabama, the tornado produced a continuous swath of damage on either side of State Line Road all the way towards the city of Cottonwood. This is also consistent of EF-1 damage. The first instance of EF-2 damage was when the tornado approached Cottonwood proper, along Ramer Loop rolling a single-wide mobile home, destroying it, despite it being well strapped. As the tornado moved through downtown Cottonwood, numerous small businesses sustained damage, ranging from blown out windows, roof damage and in one case the failure of the front-facing brick facade. Additional EF-2 damage occurred when the tornado removed the entire roof of a large two-story home. The tornado continued its northeastward jog, leaving Cottonwood proper, and commenced to destroy a two-story Moose Lodge that was composed of cinder-blocks resulting in another instance of EF-2 damage. The most significant tree damage noted on this survey occurred when the tornado paralleled Dyers Road, thus snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant damage along this northeastward path occurred on September Road where a double-wide home was completely destroyed, and resulted in one fatality. As the tornado continued to move northeast to across Whitaker Road and Creek Church Road, EF-1 tree damage was noted. The tornado caused mainly EF-0 damage to softwood and hardwood trees along Green Frog Road and Ed Tolar Road. One last structural damage occurred to a single-family home where it caused significant roof damage before lifting near the Chattahoochee River. In summary, while most damage was EF-1, there were instances of EF-2 damage with the max wind of 130 mph.

There were 14 tornadoes confirmed across the tri-state region, including 3 EF0s, 5 EF1s, 5 EF2s, and 1 EF3. This activity was driven by a deepening area of low pressure west of the region with a record strong low level jet crossing the region.

The ten confirmed tornadoes during this event is a record for the most tornadoes observed during any event in the state of West Virginia.||To top it all off, the multiple rounds of thunderstorms also resulted in excessive rainfall amounts for parts of the state. This resulted in several instances of flash flooding of creeks and streams with reported road closures due to high water, primarily during the evening of April 2nd. The transition to generalized flooding occurred during the early morning of April 3rd due to the response from larger creeks. Considerable runoff from this rainfall caused river flooding along the Tygart Valley River and its tributaries, and very heavy rainfall over Pennsylvania from these same storms led to moderate to major flooding on the Ohio River between April 4th to the 6th. One fatality occurred in Wood County on the 4th when a motorist entered flood waters and their vehicle overturned and then submerged.","A tornado touched down in the Kanawha State Forest near the Pigeon Roost Trail, then skipped along an intermittent path eastward to the Hernshaw community.

The tornado would then continue trekking east-southeast before making a hard right and traveling due east as  it passed the intersection of Blountstown Highway and Ft. Braden Trail Road, producing damage consistent with an EF-1 rating by snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees along the way. The tornado would then continue east, paralleling Blountstown Highway as it then impacted Lake Talquin State Recreational Area where it would continue producing EF-1 damage by snapping trees. The tornado would then shift its trajectory to east-southeast once again, impacting many subdivisions in the Norfleet neighborhood south of Blountstown Highway snapping numerous trees across the area. It would then continue on its east- southeast path before traveling east once again as it reached just north of the intersection of Capital Circle SW and Orange Ave W in Tallahassee. It would then go on to impact the neighborhoods of Seminole Manor and Mabry Manor snapping many trees along the way and causing damage to Sabal Palm Elementary School. The tornado would then continue its eastern track impacting Florida A&M University (FAMU) producing EF-1 damage by snapping numerous trees along the way. This included roof damage to at least two university buildings. EF-0 damage was observed a handful of times to eve's on homes and businesses as well as occasional shingle damage. The tornado would continue moving east toward Capital City Country Club Golf Course producing EF-1 damage by snapping numerous trees along the way and across the golf course. The tracks of both tornadoes moving through Tallahassee at this time converged at Capital City Country Club, with this tornado seemingly becoming the dominant circulation moving forward. As the tornado exited the golf course, very intense tree damage consistent with an EF-2 rating was observed as numerous trees were snapped at a height of around 75 feet. This most intense tree damage occurred from Country Club Dr. through the Indian Head Acres subdivisions. This is where the maximum estimated winds of 115mph most likely occurred. EF-1 damage would be observed through the remainder of its eastern trajectory as the tornado impacted Old St. Augustine Rd. It would go on producing EF-1 tree damage within the subdivision of Paradise Village East, Old Friends Rd, and areas along Southwood Plantation Rd before moving on to mostly forested areas north of Old St. Augustine Rd. The last concentrated area of EF-1 damage would be observed in neighborhoods along Louvinia Drive and WW Lee Road. The tornado would then continue east before uprooting a few trees along U.S. 27 as it moved to the Leon-Jefferson county line before dissipating. The tornado reached its maximum width of 1400yds as it crossed Monroe St. in downtown Tallahassee and entered into the Capital City Country Club Golf Course.

The Leon county portion of this tornado is rated EF2.  Extensive tree damage was noted at a mobile home park on Emily Loop where several homes were damaged by falling trees. The tornado caused roof and siding damage to a hotel and shopping center near the intersection of Capital Circle Northwest and U.S. 90. The tornado appears to have intensified as it moved southeast after crossing Capital Circle and approaching Blountstown Highway. EF-2 damage was noted to an automotive repair building along Blountstown Highway, along with intense tree damage, with a swath of nearly every pine tree snapped at approximately 75 feet above the ground. This level of damage continues across Pat Thomas Boulevard. Significant tree damage was noted on the campuses of Lively Technical College and Tallahassee Community College before the tornado crossed Appleyard Drive. Another area of intense tree damage was noted along Cactus Drive, consistent with an EF-2 rating. Numerous homes were damaged by falling trees. The tornado then moved through a densely populated area of single family and multi-family homes, causing widespread EF-1 tree damage. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged by falling trees as the tornado crossed Pensacola Street and approached the Florida State University Campus. Numerous trees were downed on the southwestern part of the campus. In addition, the tent housing the Florida State University Flying High Circus was destroyed and the outfield fence at Dick Howser Stadium was severely damaged. The tornado moved along Gaines Street, causing damage to a few businesses, and causing a construction crane to collapse. At Railroad Square, several warehouse buildings were severely damaged, along with the roof of the railroad depot. Snapped and uprooted trees were also noted in the downtown area, just south of the State Capital Building near the state Department of Education Building. At this point, the tornado began to turn more southeastward as it began to interact with the nearby tornado to its south. The tornado caused damage at Cascades Park, and significant tree damage in Myers Park. The tornado then moved through Country Club Estates and onto the Capital City Country Club. At this time, the track converged with that of the tornado to the south, with the tornado to the south appearing to become the dominant feature moving forward.

Further to the northwest at a homestead at the intersection of 240th Street and T Avenue, a home took a direct hit with the majority of its roof blown off in addition to the loss of several exterior walls on the second floor. Trees on the property were uprooted and farm outbuilding were completely destroyed and swept away. This is the strongest damage from this tornado in Montgomery County, rated EF-2 with estimated wind speeds of 130 mph. The tornado then crossed US Highway 71 three-quarters of a mile south of US Highway 34, causing damage to trees and destroying an attached garage to a residence. The walls of the garage were bolted to the foundation and had been completely swept away. The remaining house had significant roof damage, but all the walls remained. Afterwards, the tornado crossed US Highway 34 on the south side of the Hacklebarney Woods County Park. Here trees were snapped, small outbuildings were destroyed and a camping trailer was rolled on its side. The tornado then continued northeast, causing damage to outbuildings and snapping tree trunks as it crossed Vine Avenue.

Instability in the atmosphere helped to create strong to severe thunderstorms first in the form of discrete cells the night of the 29th into the early AM hours of the 30th. One of which produced a tornado in the western Oklahoma Panhandle. Then subsequent nights disturbances aloft helped create a Mesoscale Convective Complex both on the night of the 30th and again on the 31st. Besides the tornado reported on the 29th this storm in Cimarron County also produced hail up to 1.75ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in diameter. On the next two nights the severe wind gusts reaching upwards of 74 mph. Severe hail was more isolated compared to the winds that were more widespread with lines of storms surging from the northwest to the southeast on the 30th and from the west-northwest to east-southeast on the night of the 31st.,"This tornado occurred in open field near the Santa Fe Trail campground in northwest Cimarron County.

At the surface, an area of low-pressure strengthened/deepened across southwest Kansas, with a trailing dryline extending near and just west of the 100th meridian through much of the day. As ascent overspread this feature, numerous (organized) severe thunderstorms developed across the WFO Norman Forecast Area, even by as early as daybreak/early morning hours. The boundary layer was characterized by strong instability and wind shear, favorable for an organized/supercell storm mode. Initial supercells across western Oklahoma produced a few reports of large hail and the first (brief) tornadoes of the event just after 10 AM. Supercell storm development continued across portions of the area, focusing along an axis from western-north Texas into north-central Oklahoma through much of the afternoon. The first significant (EF-2) tornado of the event impacted the eastern edge of Knox City (Knox County, Texas) just after 3 PM. Through the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) organized and swept across much of southern/central Oklahoma and adjacent north Texas. Numerous mesovortex-type tornadoes developed and impacted the aforementioned areas. Ahead of the main convective line, strong warm air advection, driven by an increasing (45-60 knot) low-level jet, promoted the development of pre-frontal/line supercell thunderstorms.

We do not believe the tornado was over a mile wide, but instead there were a few smaller circulations rotating around the main tornado circulation which was likely a maximum width of about 1200 yards (.68 miles wide). The tornado entered west of the Rosston area and moved eastward to areas south of Era. Widespread tree damage, consistent with EF-0 tornado intensities, occurred between Rosston to southwest of Era. In the vicinity of FM 51 south of Era, the intensity of damage increased, with widespread tree and structural damage consistent with EF-1 winds of 90-110 mph . Some damage to at least 3 residences southeast of Era (and west of Valley View) was consistent with EF-2 tornadic winds of 115-125 mph (DI 2, DOD 6).The tornado maintained intensity as it approached Valley View from the west. Along CR 200, the upper levels and roofs of several newly constructed homes were damaged or demolished. In addition, a few walls were pushed in on the backside of the homes (west side, DI 2, DOD 6) In this area, the tornado was rated EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 140 mph. The tornado entered a neighborhood along W Lone Oak Rd which consisted of mainly manufactured and mobile homes. Widespread damage occurred in this neighborhood, and a few demolished homes were rated EF-2 (DI 3, DOD 6). Unfortunately, 7 fatalities occurred here, too. The tornado continued east, crossing I-35, damaging cars and tractor trailers on the interstate. The tornado hit a gas station (DI 8, DOD 7), metal building shop, RV and boat storage units on the corner of Lone Oak Rd and I-35. This area was rated EF-2 with estimated winds of 135 mph. The tornado tracked near and south of E Lone Oak Rd towards Ray Roberts Lake where more roof damage and notable tree damage was observed. The tornado crossed the lake, causing more tree damage and pushing over some campers on the peninsula that includes Ray Roberts Lake State Park Johnson Branch. This is where the tornado entered Denton County. In total, 80 people in Cooke County had to be transported due to injuries.

These storms continued to be severe and tornadic through the morning of the 24th, later being classified as a derecho. |Troughing over the western CONUS continued to bring southwesterly flow aloft the region even behind this first trough. By the evening of the 25th, another shortwave trough had amplified over the Great Basin and had shifted over the Rocky Mountains. Ahead of this disturbance, a low-pressure developed in northwest Kansas, with a warm front extending east-southeast across northern and eastern Kansas. The evening of the 25th, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed across this frontal zone in northern Kansas and generally tracked to the east-northeast. As such, scattered thunderstorms moved into southeast Nebraska after 9 PM CDT. While largely remaining below severe limits, severe straight-line winds were observed along the south and east side of the Omaha metro as a thunderstorm tracked from western Otoe into eastern Pottawattamie County. It was estimated wind gusts reached as high as 70 miles per hour with this storm, with power outages being reported due to the winds.","This is a continuation of the EF-1 tornado from Platte County. After moving into Colfax County, the roof of a large livestock barn was damaged, producing EF-1 damage. The tornado dissipated in an agricultural field about 5.5 miles southeast of Leigh.

Diurnal heating and weak convective inhibition allowed for renewed development of severe thunderstorms along the leading edge of this long-lived MCS. Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s ahead of this convection across North Louisiana and South Arkansas, which contributed to MLCAPE values on the order of 1500-2000 J/kg within a modestly sheared environment. Additionally, a shortwave trough associated with this convection promoted further advancement downstream into an air mass that was supportive of robust updrafts. As a result, numerous severe thunderstorms affected much of North Louisiana with widespread damaging winds and several tornadoes. In addition, isolated reports of flash flooding were also documented.","This EF-1 tornado with peak winds of 110 mph, in association with a quasi-linear convection system (surging thunderstorm squall line), began just east of Highway 175, about one mile south of Interstate 49. The highest rated damage actually was at the very start of the tornado where a barn was almost completely destroyed with many trees snapped and uprooted on that property. A well-built residence did receive damage at this location, but this was deemed to be mostly from portions of the barn and other trees flying onto the structure. From there, the tornado crossed Interstate 49, although tree damage there was not considerable. The next road impacted on the north-northeast path of the tornado was Farris Lane where a few mobile homes received minor damage and quite a few trees were downed in random directions. The tornado continued onward and another increase in strength was observed as it passed just on the western side of Frierson. There, on a short road just south of Polk Avenue, the tornado managed to throw a small metal building system (MBS) after the column anchorages failed. This sort of damage has potential to garner a rating greater than EF-1, but in this case much tamer damage immediately surrounding the MBS led the survey team to rate this damage point at just less than 100 mph. Portions of the MBS actually flew into a different property along Stonewall-Frierson Road and produced car and property damage related to the impact. The tornado only continued a little farther from this point and the last signs of damage related to the tornado were at a westward bend to Stonewall-Frierson Road on the north side of Frierson.

The most notable tornado of the event was a long-track EF-3 tornado across Montague, Cooke, and Denton counties that killed 7 people and injured over 100, drawing national attention to our forecast area and costing an estimated $20 million in damage. A short but intense satellite tornado was also rated EF-3 north of Celina in Collin County. Additional EF-1 tornadoes occurred in Denton, Collin, and Hunt counties. Storm surveys for this event took 3 days to complete. In the after math of the storms the night of May 25th, dissipating thunderstorms produced strong winds across the DFW Metroplex with measured gusts of 60-70 mph winds causing sporadic tree and fence damage.","An EF-1 tornado with maximum estimated winds of 95 mph formed along County Road 58, south of County Road 59. The tornado tracked a little over 8 miles to the southwest causing scattered damage along the path, but consistent enough along the track of the radar circulation.

Interaction with a surface boundary allowed for tornadogenesis in a few of the storms as low-level streamwise vorticity was ingested into updrafts. Three of the tornadoes were fairly weak, at EF0 level, with one EF1 impacting areas within the Pittsburgh city limits, including the Pittsburgh Zoo. No straight-line wind or hail reports were received, as the storms were small and as the environment did not support those impacts. One isolated flood report was also received in Allegheny County.","Damage was first noted in the vicinity of the Penn Township  Municipal Complex, where flag poles were bent, and a tree limb was snapped.

The tornado continued northeast crossing agricultural fields and flipping numerous center pivots, eventually crossing 252nd Street. The tornado caused EF-2 damage as it approached Highway 92, damaging numerous homes and striking an acreage northwest of the Highway 92 (West Center street) and Highway 275 intersection. Several center pivots were overturned as the tornado continued northeast crossing east of Highway 275, causing EF-2 damage to several acreages, homes, and outbuildings along Highway 275/240th Street. Continuing northeast, the tornado crossed 234th Street near Harney Street where it damaged a horse farm and an acreage as well as a home along Dodge Street/Highway 6 before crossing Dodge Street causing roof and outbuilding damage at the Junkstock Farm. The tornado crossed the Elkhorn River, damaging trees and flipping center pivots in an acreage along Blondo Street just south of the railroad tracks. The tornado continued into the western part of Elkhorn approximately one-half mile south-southwest of the intersection of West Maple Road and 216th Street. One home sustained high-end EF-2 damage losing large sections of its roofs. Another home just to the north had total destruction of the structure, resulting in EF-4 damage. The tornado moved across Prospect Hills Cemetery, damaging headstones, and moved across West Maple Avenue severely damaging a landscape business before entering the Ramblewood subdivision. Numerous homes in the subdivision received EF-3 damage with only small interior rooms standing. EF-3 damage persisted as the tornado continued north-northeastward damaging homes between 212th Street and Kestrel Parkway, again leaving only interior rooms standing.  Two homes at the intersection of North 212th Street and Larimor Avenue were completely destroyed, resulting in a second instance of EF-4 damage. The tornado then crossed Fort Street about one-third of a mile east of 216th Street, causing the collapse of new development homes. This damage was also consistent with that of an EF-3 tornado. The tornado then veered to the northeast across mainly rural areas of northwestern Douglas County, between Fort Street and Military Road. By the time the tornado crossed Highway 31, it reached its peak width of 1 mile wide. EF-1 damage was noted in this area with several power poles and trees snapped. The tornado narrowed to about one-half mile wide and moved into residential development just northwest of the intersection of 180th Street and Military Road, where EF-1 damage was observed due to loss of roofs. The tornado then moved into Benningtonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Newport Landing neighborhood, causing high-end EF-2 damage by removing large sections of several home's roofs and collapsing some exterior walls. The tornado then moved across Bennington Lake, crossing just west of the intersection of Highway 36 and 168th Street, snapping the tops off of numerous trees. It then moved across agricultural land, damaging farm outbuildings southeast of the intersection of 168th Street and Dutch Hall Road, before crossing into Washington County.  All walls of this home were collapsed. However, the walls were not attached to the foundation in a way that would discriminate between EF-3 and EF-4 damage. Thus, high-end EF-3 damage was determined. Peak estimated winds for this segment of the tornado's track were at 170 miles per hour.

After crossing Dutch Hall road into southern Washington County, the tornado damaged homes and farm outbuildings between County Road 29 and County Road 31 from Dutch Hall Road to County Road 36. The width of the tornado at this time ranged from one-third to one-half mile wide. The most significant damage was sustained to a home, machine shop and horse barn, one-third of a mile southeast of the intersection of County Road 40 and County Road 29. Trees were snapped and debarked, the house was moved from its foundation, flat-bed and horse-trailers rolled or lofted, and the machine shop and horse barns destroyed. The storm damage survey following this tornado determined high-end EF-3 damage occurred here. At least one horse was killed, and several others were injured. After this, the tornado crossed the intersection of County Road 36 and County Road 31, producing EF-0 to EF-1 damage in the form of partial roof and siding loss to farm buildings and manufactured homes, plus the snapping of large tree limbs. As it approached State Highway 133, several homes and farm outbuildings sustained EF-2 damage due to the loss of roofs or exterior walls. Crossing Highway 133, the tornado was just less than one-half mile wide, and moved into residential areas generally between County Road 32 and US Highway 75. The most significant damage of the whole tornado track occurred near the intersections of County Road P30 and County Road 33 with the destruction of multiple homes. Several houses were rated with high-end EF-3 damage, and one house was rated as receiving EF-4 damage. Peak winds in this area were estimated to be 170 miles per hour.

At the surface, a stationary front developed and stretched across central Nebraska and southern Iowa by the evening of the 19th. Elevated convection that morning north of the developing surface boundary resulted in isolated instances of severe hail and wind across southeast Nebraska.

Numerous rounds of strong and severe thunderstorms that night brought widespread severe weather and flash flooding, primarily across east-central Nebraska and southwest Iowa, though some elevated supercells in northeast Nebraska brought small hail to the area. After 10 UTC, an intense line of severe thunderstorms moved across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa bringing wind gusts ranging from 60 to 95 miles per hour, in addition to several spin-up tornadoes.  |As the primary upper level disturbance ejected out over the Great Plains, intense surface cyclogenesis was noted over eastern Nebraska.

The synoptic pattern across the western half of the Continental United States favored a significant severe weather episode across the region, with a powerful (110-120 knot) upper-level jet streak ejecting across the Central Plains during the evening of the 6th. In concert with robust kinematics in place, extreme instability (pockets of >4000-5000 J/kg of CAPE) promoted an environment favorable for significant severe weather.

Upper air analysis shows a jet streak on the downstream side of this trough with substantial divergence aloft over Nebraska. At the surface, morning cloud cover and drizzle across much of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa quickly gave way to partly cloud skies as a warm front moved north through the area, just after noon. At the same time, thunderstorms initiated along a pacific front/dryline in south-central Nebraska. One supercell produced several tornadoes from south-central Nebraska into Boone County, resulting in an EF-2 tornado just west of Cedar Rapids. A second round of supercells initiated in Jefferson and Saline counties. These long-track supercells produced the worst tornado outbreak the Omaha WFO has seen in 10 years. 5 EF-3 tornadoes were surveyed, with several of these tornadoes just shy of an EF-4 rating. One of these EF-3 tornadoes impacted the northeast side of Lincoln, Nebraska where 70 people were reported trapped in a manufacturing plant that collapsed as the tornado passed. Another long-track EF-3 tornado hit portions of Elkhorn, Bennington and Blair, Nebraska.

While one remained primarily in rural areas in the central part of the county, the final EF-3 of the day hit the town of Minden, Iowa head-on, resulting in 1 fatality and 3 injuries.

Prior to this segment, the tornado had tracked through Pottawattamie County and a small portion of extreme southeast Harrison County. After crossing into Shelby County between York Road and 335th Street, tree and powerline damage continued to the northeast, with a home having its roof blown off near County Road M16 and 450th Street. Trees in the area were uprooted or snapped at the base of the trunk. A home was badly damaged, and a barn was destroyed less than one mile southeast of Tennant. The tornado appears to have been widest near 750th Street and Hackberry Road, at approximately 1900 yards in width based on tree and powerline damage. At Highway 44, a home was destroyed along with substantial tree damage. Most walls of the home were standing, but a large automobile was thrown or rolled nearly a quarter mile. The tree and vehicle damage suggested that this location was a stronger section of the tornado, and was subsequently rated EF-3. The tornado tracked approximately 1.5 miles northwest of Harlan and began to turn more towards the north, significantly damaging at least 3 homes near Highway 59 as it crossed. It turned almost due north and traveled several miles along Linden Road, and missed the town of Defiance, Iowa by less than half a mile to the east. A second tornado developed just to the east of this one at this time, tracking along Oak Road and causing separate damage. Near Defiance the tornado also became rain-wrapped according to chaser video, and appears likely to have ended just south of the Crawford-Shelby county line. There is some potential based on radar data that this tornado tracked farther north into Crawford County, but damage surveys did not identify a track continuation. The peak estimated winds in this segment of the tornado track were 140 miles per hour.

An outbuilding was totally destroyed near Sycamore Road, and the tornado caused extensive tree damage east of 330th Road, south of Minden. The tornado intensified further, and widened to approximately 1200 yards as it impacted the town of Minden.

With time, as storms matured and moved into an environment characterized by richer low-level moisture, and as low-level flow increased, multiple tornado occurrences did result. Additional supercell thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters developed by the late evening of the 6th across west-central into central Oklahoma. A particularly impactful cluster moved across the southern Oklahoma City Metropolitan area, producing numerous reports of significant thunderstorm wind damage (and gusts) and two weak tornadoes.",A brief tornado damaged an outbuilding near Marshall Road.,CSV,5000,0,5000

Another tornado was observed near the town of Westwood, where a single-wide trailer was flipped over and significant damage was noted of homes and structures. Numerous areas of tree and power line damage were also seen across northeast Kentucky due to damaging wind gusts associated with the squall line.||In addition to wind and tornado damage, heavy downpours associated with rounds of storms led to flooding across portions of northeast Kentucky on April 3rd. Several roads were closed during this time due to high water issues as adjacent creeks and streams rose out of their banks. In the span of these two days, between 3 to 5 inches of rain had fallen along the Ohio River basin from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, which eventually flowed down the river into Kentucky.

This included six significant (EF-2+) tornadoes and one violent (EF-4) tornado that struck Marietta (Love County). ||Synoptically, a slow-moving and deep mid/upper-level wave progressed across the Four Corners region during the day. At the surface, an area of low-pressure strengthened/deepened across southwest Kansas, with a trailing dryline extending near and just west of the 100th meridian through much of the day. As ascent overspread this feature, numerous (organized) severe thunderstorms developed across the WFO Norman Forecast Area, even by as early as daybreak/early morning hours. The boundary layer was characterized by strong instability and wind shear, favorable for an organized/supercell storm mode. Initial supercells across western Oklahoma produced a few reports of large hail and the first (brief) tornadoes of the event just after 10 AM. Supercell storm development continued across portions of the area, focusing along an axis from western-north Texas into north-central Oklahoma through much of the afternoon. The first significant (EF-2) tornado of the event impacted the eastern edge of Knox City (Knox County, Texas) just after 3 PM. Through the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) organized and swept across much of southern/central Oklahoma and adjacent north Texas. Numerous mesovortex-type tornadoes developed and impacted the aforementioned areas.

In addition to damage associated with the tornadoes, over 100 locations reported non-tornadic wind damage.||Additional thunderstorms later in the afternoon produced another tornado in the Hico community of Fayette County. The ten confirmed tornadoes during this event is a record for the most tornadoes observed during any event in the state of West Virginia.||To top it all off, the multiple rounds of thunderstorms also resulted in excessive rainfall amounts for parts of the state.

The storm was spawned along a dryline over the southwest Texas Panhandle late in the afternoon, fueled by temperatures rising into the 90s. Moisture initially was on the moderate side, but that quickly changed, due to an outflow boundary advancing westward across the Interstate 27 corridor. East of the outflow boundary, temperatures were a little cooler, but the air was very moist due to a thunderstorm complex that moved across the eastern Texas Panhandle, western Oklahoma, and much of North Texas earlier in the day. The outflow boundary did trigger a few morning and early afternoon thunderstorms from near Childress (Childress County) to south of Paducah (Cottle County) to northeast of Aspermont (Stonewall County). Some of these storms were on the strong side and produced brief torrential rainfall. Thunderstorms along the dryline were initially not well organized, but quickly changed as they encountered the outflow boundary. The increased moisture and instability, in combination with stout southeasterly upslope winds caused the thunderstorms to quickly organize and strengthen. The dominant storm across the southern Texas Panhandle quickly intensified near Happy (Swisher County) with strong mid-level rotation developing. The cyclonic rotation strengthened and lowered with time as the storm tracked more easterly, then southeasterly. Extreme lift within the storm generated giant hail, while a wall cloud developed, lowered, and produced a tornado after passing very close to Vigo Park (Swisher County). Gargantuan hail fell from the storm, including a 7.02 inch diameter stone which was observed a few miles west-northwest of Vigo Park. This hailstone was confirmed as a new record for the largest diameter hailstone in Texas, surpassing the old record which was 6.416 inches in Hondo (Medina County) in 2021.

This is the location of the first tornado that was reported. Early on the evening of June second, a supercell thunderstorm developed in far northern Swisher County. The storm crossed an outflow boundary as it moved east across northern and eastern Swisher County resulting in increasing rotation and development of a low-level mesocyclone. Storm chasers reported a tornado as the storm crossed into western Briscoe County.

This event unfolded as a powerful upper trough, along with a surface low/trough, moved into the Central Plains. Locally, a northward-arcing warm front passed through south central and central Nebraska. Dewpoints were generally in the 50s and 60s during the early afternoon hours on April 26th across south central and central Nebraska. Most unstable CAPE was around 1,000 to 3,000 J/kg and wind shear was around 40 knots, setting the stage for tornado development within parts of Buffalo, Sherman and especially Howard and Greeley counties. ||Storms already began developing in south central and central Nebraska during the late morning hours. The storms began by producing nickel sized hail in Sherman County just after 12 PM CDT. The first tornado of the day developed around 12:16 PM CDT from a supercell moving across northern Buffalo County into Sherman County and was rated as an EF1. This storm moved northward and split into two storms with the second storm on the right becoming stronger and continuing to move north northeast. These two storms produced a total of six tornadoes in Buffalo, Sherman, Howard, and Greeley Counties. The last tornado of the day developed in Greeley County just after 2 PM CDT and moved northeastward before exiting this local area into Boone County (which is located in the Eastern Nebraska area). The strongest tornado within the south central Nebraska area was rated an EF3, passing very near Elba in Howard County (this was the strongest tornado to strike the 24-county area in nearly 10 years...since EF-3 tornadoes on May 11, 2014). Other storms developed and produced hail. The largest hail was golf ball sized which fell in Howard County around 1:15 PM CDT. Prior to departing the local area, they produced quarter sized hail in Nance County just after 3 PM CDT.","This tornado started about four miles northeast of Wolbach and was associated with a parent supercell that had previously produced two other tornadoes. In Greeley County, damage was confined mainly to center irrigation pivots and trees. The tornado moved northeast over open country and crossed the Boone County line along Highway 56. In Boone County, the tornado caused minor damage to a home on a farmstead at the county line along with quite a bit of tree damage in the general area. The tornado moved north and appeared to strengthen some as it flipped and tossed several central irrigation pivots north of Highway 56. Power poles were snapped and debris was lifted into power lines. As the tornado moved north-northeast, the most significant damage was found about two miles southwest of Primrose. A single-family home was extensively damaged, including the three-car garage being totally ripped away along with much of the roof structure. Several outbuildings were damaged or destroyed. Extensive tree damage and numerous power poles were snapped in the area. Tree damage was widespread west of Primrose and one large outbuilding was destroyed. In its final few miles, the tornado damaged trees and irrigation pivots in several places. Extensive damage to a livestock facility and several snapped power poles were noted about halfway between Primrose and Petersburg. The tornado likely dissipated in open country as it approached the Beaver Creek southwest of Petersburg. The widest point of the tornado appeared to occur just to the west and southwest of Primrose when the tornado may have been at least 500 yards wide.

This led to moderate buoyancy with upper 60s to lower 70s surface dew points. Upscale growth continued along the regenerating MCS as it propagated farther east across the Ark-La-Tex early into the evening. With a favorable deep layer wind profile (0-6km shear near 50 knots), supercells were possible with any emerging thunderstorm clusters. Although shear profiles favored supercells, primary storm mode remained the MCS. Even so, a few tornadoes resulted within embedded circulations, along a few very discrete storm structures that evolved independently of the MCS. Meanwhile, the leading edge of a surging bow echo resulted in widespread damaging winds across Northwest Louisiana with the mature squall line.

The storm was spawned along a dryline over the southwest Texas Panhandle late in the afternoon, fueled by temperatures rising into the 90s. Moisture initially was on the moderate side, but that quickly changed, due to an outflow boundary advancing westward across the Interstate 27 corridor. East of the outflow boundary, temperatures were a little cooler, but the air was very moist due to a thunderstorm complex that moved across the eastern Texas Panhandle, western Oklahoma, and much of North Texas earlier in the day. The outflow boundary did trigger a few morning and early afternoon thunderstorms from near Childress (Childress County) to south of Paducah (Cottle County) to northeast of Aspermont (Stonewall County). Some of these storms were on the strong side and produced brief torrential rainfall. Thunderstorms along the dryline were initially not well organized, but quickly changed as they encountered the outflow boundary. The increased moisture and instability, in combination with stout southeasterly upslope winds caused the thunderstorms to quickly organize and strengthen. The dominant storm across the southern Texas Panhandle quickly intensified near Happy (Swisher County) with strong mid-level rotation developing. The cyclonic rotation strengthened and lowered with time as the storm tracked more easterly, then southeasterly. Extreme lift within the storm generated giant hail, while a wall cloud developed, lowered, and produced a tornado after passing very close to Vigo Park (Swisher County). Gargantuan hail fell from the storm, including a 7.02 inch diameter stone which was observed a few miles west-northwest of Vigo Park. This hailstone was confirmed as a new record for the largest diameter hailstone in Texas, surpassing the old record which was 6.416 inches in Hondo (Medina County) in 2021. After becoming tornadic, the storm continued to move southeastward, passing several miles to the north and northeast of Silverton (Briscoe County). The first tornado gradually dissipated, but another tornado formed as this was occurring, with two tornadoes in contact with the ground for roughly four to five minutes. Thereafter, the newly formed tornado became the dominant tornado and persisted another 20 minutes before dissipating east of Texas Highway 207 and north of Texas Highway 256.

On the synoptic scale, a shortwave trough centered in the middle of the country with a 60 kt mid-level jet moved across northern Arkansas. A weak surface low was moving into SE Missouri during the morning with a secondary low located further northwest. A warm frontal boundary was draped across our area. A bowing line progressed east across SE Missouri into W Kentucky and far S Illinois between 0500-1000CST, followed by a mostly sub-severe second line that exited the region by 1300CST. The environment recovered producing fuel for more severe storms, starting with supercells 1800-2100CST with a line of storms moving east-southeastward across the entire Quad State after 1900CST, crossing through by midnight. Across the Quad State, this event produced the record for most tornado track miles in a single day in office history, along with the second most warnings issued in a day (just behind the May 8, 2024 event). Widespread straight-line wind and tornado damage resulted in over 100,000 customers without power across the Quad State.||For the morning, MLCAPE values at 0700CST were 1000-2000 J/kg in W Kentucky. Effective bulk shear was 30-40 kts with STP around 1, which increased in the following hours. Precipitable water was 1.5-1.8 inches, allowing for torrential rainfall rates.||The morning round of storms produced widespread destructive straight-line wind damage leading to numerous power outages across the southernmost portions of W Kentucky from the Jackson Purchase Area to the Southern Pennyrile. Two EF-1 tornadoes occurred in Calloway County, with one of them tracking 22 miles. One person was injured when thunderstorm winds caused a tree to fall on his vehicle on Rockwood Rd in Calloway County. Two more tornadoes formed in Trigg County, one an EF-1, and an EF-2 that produced its strongest damage south of Hopkinsville in Christian County. Another EF-1 tornado formed northwest of Bremen and tracked northeastward to Island in McLean County. Torrential rainfall rates led to a few reports of flash flooding in Western Kentucky during the morning to early afternoon hours. ||Heading into the evening, MLCAPE values at 1800CST were 2000-3500 J/kg in W Kentucky. For W Kentucky, effective bulk shear rose to 45-55 kts, with SRH around 200-400 m2/s2 and STP of 2-4. 0-1 km shear was 20-30 kts. Mid-level lapse rates were 7-7.5 C/km. DCAPE of 1100-1400 J/kg provided ample opportunity for downburst winds.||Late afternoon to early evening supercells produced hail reports and a long-track EF-3 tornado that began in Lyon County, then continued east-northeastward through Caldwell and Hopkins Counties. Severe structural damage occurred between Dawson Springs and Charleston and at least one family in Barnsley lost their home for the second time with the previous instance being the historic December 10, 2021 tornado. 21 people were injured (4 in Caldwell, 17 in Hopkins) while two people lost their lives, one in Hopkins County from the tornado (48f, direct), and one in Caldwell County due to a heart attack while cleaning up tornado debris (54m, indirect). The cold front swept through, producing more straight-line wind damage and flash flooding. As the line caught up to the supercell tornado, the storm became much more muddled, with an EF-1 tornado taking shape in Muhlenberg County tracking southeastward through Beech Creek and Beechmont, and continuing as a long track tornado reaching areas north of Bowling Green.

Damage was more sporadic and minor but grew more intense in south Murray with a few healthy tree trunks snapped. Damage then continued more sporadically just south of KY-121. Several wheat fields showed complicated swirl and straight line wind damage patterns along this path. Damage became more intense once again southwest of New Concord before moving across KY-121 and into the Cypress Springs community where several roads were impassable due to fallen trees.

The supercell that tracked through Crow Wing and Aitkin County produced four separate tornadoes, first on/near Upper Whitefish Lake across to Clamshell Lake, or west of Crosslake, where a wide, sharp path of damage was found. This tornado dissipated, with a second tornado forming south of Wolford, west of Rabbit Lake (north of Crosby). This second tornado appeared to have a mainly continuous path of damage from near Wolford to Rabbit Lake to Cedar Lake to Prescott Lake.

Initially the tornado was a narrow tornado, then as it turned east-northeast quickly become a large multiple-vortex tornado as observed visually and in the damage pattern. The total damage width was about 2.7 miles along N2240 Road, including both damaging inflow winds north of the tornado and very strong damaging Rear Flank Downdraft (RFD) winds south of the tornado, but the tornado width itself was about one mile wide based on the damage survey and preliminary mobile radar data from Texas Tech University.

At least two outbuildings were destroyed and two others damaged and one home had roof damage. As the tornado approached N2260 Road, a trailer and a rail car used for storage were blown a significant distance to the west, despite being on the southern periphery of the damage area, giving further evidence of the multiple-vortex tornado.||Preliminary data from a Ka-band mobile research radar from Texas Tech University showed a peak instantaneous velocity of 87.9 m/s (197 mph) at about 30 meters AGL when the tornado was approximately 6 miles west-northwest of Custer City.

The latter was a very potent thunderstorm line racing eastward early morning April 2nd with the southern end of the line of severe weather just over the Ohio River in Western Kentucky. Weaker thunderstorm activity occurred further south in the southern Jackson Purchase and most of the Pennyrile. This line continued throughout the day all the way to West Virginia, being designated a derecho. For Western Kentucky, 4 tornadoes occurred, 1 in far Western McCracken County (EF-1), and 3 in Union County (1 EF-2, 2 EF-1), with 1 injury due to a tree falling on a manufactured home from the Sullivan tornado in Union County.  According to county EMA, in Union County, 22 homes were damaged, with 8 destroyed and 3 suffering major damage. A few instances of straight-line wind damage also occurred in counties bordering the Ohio River (Ballard, McCracken, and Union).","A brief EF-1 tornado struck just east of the Woodville community in far Western McCracken County, KY.

The first round of severe weather occurred between 9 AM and 12 PM as a line of severe thunderstorms raced eastward and impacted many locations near and north of the Mountain Parkway. Along this line, several surges and pockets of circulation developed over the Bluegrass. Bath County suffered the brunt of the line, with many instances of straight line wind damage, though substantial damage was also observed in Fleming and Rowan counties. Pockets of damage were also noted in most other counties along and north of the Parkway. An NWS storm survey estimated that winds reached 70 to 90 knots in three northwest to southeast-oriented swaths across Bath County. A couple of brief spin-up tornadoes also appear to have occurred within 2 of the swaths near the communities of Sharpsburg and Reynoldsville.  ||Once the late morning thunderstorm activity weakened, a messy mixture of showers and a few thunderstorms lifted across eastern Kentucky through the afternoon. Severe weather was not observed again until early evening when a couple of supercell thunderstorms developed over central/eastern Tennessee and moved into southeast Kentucky. The first storm, tracking northeast just east of Pine Mountain, produced a swath of hail up to half dollar size, though much of it likely fell in remote and rugged terrain. A second supercell thunderstorm moved northeast across the Cumberland River basin and eventually weakened over the basin of the South Fork Kentucky River. This storm produced pockets of wind damage, the most severe of which was observed in northeast Whitley County where many trees, multiple structures and an RV park suffered significant damage. An NWS storm survey found damage consistent with winds gusts of 80 to 90 mph in this area about 7 miles southwest of Corbin. Additional details on this straight line wind event in Whitley County and also the straight line wind/tornado event in the Bluegrass are available here and here, respectively.","Straight line winds pushed through Mount Pleasant Road from west to east, resulting in damage to structures on both the north and south side of this mobile home.

All damage that was viewed downstream by the survey team seemed to be more in line with straight-line winds as well, so this was likely a very quick spin-up. There was a lack of structures behind this mobile home, and a lack of damage across the street to the east of this home. It matched up well with one of the tighter circulations that went through the area. The mobile home itself was hit from the backside, lifting off the roof on the back half of the house.

The first round of severe weather occurred between 9 AM and 12 PM as a line of severe thunderstorms raced eastward and impacted many locations near and north of the Mountain Parkway. Along this line, several surges and pockets of circulation developed over the Bluegrass. Bath County suffered the brunt of the line, with many instances of straight line wind damage, though substantial damage was also observed in Fleming and Rowan counties. Pockets of damage were also noted in most other counties along and north of the Parkway. An NWS storm survey estimated that winds reached 70 to 90 knots in three northwest to southeast-oriented swaths across Bath County. A couple of brief spin-up tornadoes also appear to have occurred within 2 of the swaths near the communities of Sharpsburg and Reynoldsville.  ||Once the late morning thunderstorm activity weakened, a messy mixture of showers and a few thunderstorms lifted across eastern Kentucky through the afternoon. Severe weather was not observed again until early evening when a couple of supercell thunderstorms developed over central/eastern Tennessee and moved into southeast Kentucky. The first storm, tracking northeast just east of Pine Mountain, produced a swath of hail up to half dollar size, though much of it likely fell in remote and rugged terrain. A second supercell thunderstorm moved northeast across the Cumberland River basin and eventually weakened over the basin of the South Fork Kentucky River. This storm produced pockets of wind damage, the most severe of which was observed in northeast Whitley County where many trees, multiple structures and an RV park suffered significant damage. An NWS storm survey found damage consistent with winds gusts of 80 to 90 mph in this area about 7 miles southwest of Corbin. Additional details on this straight line wind event in Whitley County and also the straight line wind/tornado event in the Bluegrass are available here and here, respectively.","A quick spin up occurred as winds descended to the ground in NW Bath County, hitting a house on top of a ridge off of Springfield Road (south of Sharpsburg), along with trees and a barn in the adjacent holler to the east. From this point forward, the event became more straight-line wind dominated and continued to be so throughout much of the county. The house sustained substantial damage. A large section of roofing was removed, including a large hole into the master closet. All windows around entire house had been bowed in, bending the frames and cracking the molding around them. Grass, dirt, insulation, and other small debris was also plastered to windows, doors, and siding on all sides of the house, including on all sides of a sheltered screen in porch. Flashing was also removed from inside the sheltered porch. Basement doors on other side of sheltering retaining wall were buckled in by the force of the wind (and possible change in pressure). House also had multiple cracks along the exterior brick-work that were not there before. In addition, it moved several things outside, including a large trailer holding the front of a combine, twisting the tongue of the trailer. Debris from the house was blown several hundred yards away, and some has not yet been found. Farther down from the house, numerous trees and a barn was hit.

A strong capping inversion suppressed storm activity in the evening, but the strong lift and upper level diffluence won out early morning. Two lines of storms developed after midnight in Southeast Missouri. The first just missed to the north of Gibson County. The latter was a very potent thunderstorm line racing eastward early morning April 2nd. This line continued throughout the day all the way to West Virginia, being designated a derecho.

Of the Tri-Cities, Hastings was by far the most severely impacted, with several reports of wind gusts around 60 MPH and extensive tree damage in and around town. An 85 MPH wind gust was measured just west of Hastings in the Heartwell area. As storms continued eastward during the early morning hours of the 24th, damaging wind remained the primary threat. The strongest and most concentrated area of wind reports occurred roughly along the Highway 74 corridor in Clay and Fillmore Counties. Here, a 75 MPH gust was measured by a mesonet just E of Edgar. The severe portion of the line exited eastern portions of the forecast area by 2AM on the 24th. In total, there were 5 confirmed tornadoes from this event, all of which were of the weak and QLCS variety. The most impactful tornado, and the only one to hit a population center, was in Holdrege, but even this damage was fairly minor and rated as an EF1.","This EF0 rated tornado damaged a handful of irrigation pivots and trees along its over eight mile path. The peak wind speed was estimated to be 85 MPH, based upon tree damage near the middle of the path. This tornado was also noted by a drop in the WSR-88D correlation coefficient product. The drop coincides with the path, but damage was very limited. One possible theory is the lower correlation coefficient shown on radar was caused by corn stalks lifted into the air from several no-till fields.",CSV,350000,250000,600000

Thunderstorms initially developed over the Nebraska Panhandle during the late afternoon hours, then shifted eastward through the evening, arriving in far western portions of the forecast area (Dawson and Gosper Counties) between 7-8PM CDT. By this time, activity had organized into a NE to SW line, though some supercells remained embedded within the broader line. Of particular note and intensity was the portion of the line between Elwood and Holdrege in which a supercell evolved into a bowing line segment. During this transition,  the primary threat changed from large hail (locally up to around golf ball size) to damaging straight line winds and brief tornadoes. The most notable and damaging tornadoes occurred near Atlanta and Holdrege. In fact, the town of Holdrege  was quite fortunate in that two separate tornadoes touched down, one on the north side of town and one of the east side. Damage in town was relatively minimal (downed trees, power lines, small outbuildings), with the most costly and prevalent issue likely being the wind-driven hail. However, several homes and farmsteads just outside of town received more significant building damage up to EF-1 intensity. A single home was damaged just W of Atlanta in the first brief tornado of the event. Another two tornadoes were surveyed later in the event, but these were weak (EF-0), for an event total of 5 tornadoes. East of Hwy 183, the primary severe threat was damaging straight line winds in the 60-70 MPH range between 10PM and midnight. Severe wind gusts were reported in all three of the Tri-Cities.

It appears the tornado briefly lifted as it moved north of 6th Avenue, sparing neighborhoods in northeast Holdrege more significant damage, before touching back down in a field just northwest of the intersection of 18th Avenue and Lincoln Street. The tornado reached peak intensity and width near Lincoln Street and 25th Avenue just northeast of Holdrege where significant damage to outbuildings, some newer and well-built, was noted. Damage also occurred to roofs of a few homes. The tornado would go on to overturn numerous pivots and snap a few more power poles as it curved northeast.

Of particular note and intensity was the portion of the line between Elwood and Holdrege in which a supercell evolved into a bowing line segment. During this transition,  the primary threat changed from large hail (locally up to around golf ball size) to damaging straight line winds and brief tornadoes. The most notable and damaging tornadoes occurred near Atlanta and Holdrege. In fact, the town of Holdrege  was quite fortunate in that two separate tornadoes touched down, one on the north side of town and one of the east side. Damage in town was relatively minimal (downed trees, power lines, small outbuildings), with the most costly and prevalent issue likely being the wind-driven hail. However, several homes and farmsteads just outside of town received more significant building damage up to EF-1 intensity. A single home was damaged just W of Atlanta in the first brief tornado of the event. Another two tornadoes were surveyed later in the event, but these were weak (EF-0), for an event total of 5 tornadoes. East of Hwy 183, the primary severe threat was damaging straight line winds in the 60-70 MPH range between 10PM and midnight. Severe wind gusts were reported in all three of the Tri-Cities. Activity largely shifted east into eastern Nebraska by around midnight.||Finally, it's worth noting that heavy rain caused brief issues with the I-80 eastbound ramps near Elm Creek. No other instances or impacts of flash flooding were reported.","This tornado danced its way along an approximately six mile path in rural eastern Webster County and ended in far western Nuckolls County.

The tornado crossed the highway and sporadically damaged some trees for the next couple of miles. The tornado eventually grazed another farmstead and damaged a couple areas of cedar trees.

The most notable and damaging tornadoes occurred near Atlanta and Holdrege. In fact, the town of Holdrege  was quite fortunate in that two separate tornadoes touched down, one on the north side of town and one of the east side. Damage in town was relatively minimal (downed trees, power lines, small outbuildings), with the most costly and prevalent issue likely being the wind-driven hail. However, several homes and farmsteads just outside of town received more significant building damage up to EF-1 intensity. A single home was damaged just W of Atlanta in the first brief tornado of the event. Another two tornadoes were surveyed later in the event, but these were weak (EF-0), for an event total of 5 tornadoes.

Out ahead of the cold front in northeast Minnesota, discrete severe thunderstorms began to form in far northeast Minnesota along the US Hwy 53 corridor around 4 PM CT. The first Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued at 4:15 PM for parts of far northeast St. Louis County and northwest Lake County as the severe storm moved northeastward around 30 mph. By 4:55 PM, conditions within a different severe supercell thunderstorm warranted the first Tornado Warning of the evening to be issued for central St. Louis County around the communities of Cotton and Canyon, MN. Between 5 and 5:30 PM that evening, multiple additional Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado Warnings were issued along and east of US Hwy 53 and along the I-35 corridor into east- central Minnesota. The cold front continued to move eastward through the early evening hours on the 19th, with storms beginning to enter Douglas and Burnett Counties in northwest Wisconsin towards 6 PM as low-level funnel clouds were reported by law enforcement and trained weather spotters. Hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter was reported from the strongest thunderstorms, but in very localized reports. As the air mass began to cool and stabilized in the mid-evening hours, the threat for additional tornadoes began to wane and the strongest thunderstorms were limited to the Twin Ports and across northwest Wisconsin. As the cold front entered northwest Wisconsin by late evening, activity subsided to only showers and general thunderstorms with no additional impacts reported overnight. In total, eight Tornado Warnings, nine Severe Thunderstorms Warnings and two Special Marine Warnings were issued for this severe weather event. The Cotton/Canyon Tornado is the only confirmed tornado from this severe weather event at this time. While funnel clouds were reported with several other storms, there is currently no evidence that any of the other storms produced a tornado that reached the ground and produced damage.","A supercell thunderstorm formed halfway between Meadowlands and Canyon, MN, between 4:35 to 4:40 PM on Thursday, September 19, 2024. As the strong thunderstorm continued to show potential for producing a tornado, the National Weather Service office in Duluth, MN, issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning at 4:44 PM for this storm. The strong storm moved eastward over unpopulated marshes immediately north of Lake Nichols Road about 4 miles north-northwest of Canyon, MN, by 5:00 PM. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service issued a Tornado Warning for this storm at 4:55 PM as early signs of tornadic development appeared on radar, and a short time later a tornado was confirmed by trained spotters and law enforcement. Visible tree damage from the tornado, estimated to have begun at 5:05 PM CDT, was first observed on the west side of US Highway 53 about 4.5 miles south of Cotton, MN, with pine trees snapped at the base. The tornado continued to move northeastward to uproot trees along Three Lakes Road about one-half mile east of the U.S. Highway 53 intersection. The storm began to move more north-northeastward so the tornado track shifted more northward with the most widespread surveyed damage seen along Bug Creek Road about 2.5 miles east-southeast of Cotton, MN. Over 50 pine trees and numerous clusters of aspen trees were observed to be snapped at the base and/or uprooted, estimated to have occurred at around 5:15 PM. A few still-standing pine trees had metal sheets lofted and wrapped around them. Minor to moderate structure damage was reported by two property owners along Bug Creek Road before the tornado passed northward over the Whiteface River. Towards 5:18 PM, the tornado began to weaken and finally lifted off the ground. The last uprooted trees, 4 aspen, were last observed at the intersection of Comstock Lake Road and Melrude Road, 2.7 miles east of Cotton, MN. In total, the tornado was on the ground for a total of 5.9 miles and for around 13 minutes.

The tornado moved north-northeast, eventually affecting several western Palm Beach County communities. A National Weather Service survey identified the southernmost surveyed point in the Rustic Ranches section of Wellington where a double-wide mobile home on Deer Path Lane was left practically unrecognizable, rated as an EF-3 at this location with 7 injuries reported. The tornado tracked north-northeast over the far western portion of Wellington, across the Lakefield West, Meadowwood, and Binks Forest communities, where EF-1 and EF-2 damage was noted to homes and trees. The tornado crossed Southern Boulevard/US Highway 98, then continued north-northeast across Loxahatchee Groves and The Acreage where EF-1 to isolated EF-2 damage was observed to homes, trees, and outbuildings. The tornado intensified as it approached Northlake Boulevard on the north end of The Acreage, then did its most considerable damage in the Avenir community of Palm Beach Gardens. At the beginning of this community, a large portion of the roof collapsed of a Publix supermarket building which was recently completed and set to open in the near future, and rated EF-3. Considerable structural damage rated EF-2 and EF-3, including heavy roof damage, impact-resistant windows which were shattered and blown in, and vehicles lifted and moved at least 100 yards were observed. The tornado then moved just west but very close to North Palm Beach County General Aviation Airport, where a wind gust of 92 mph from the south-southwest was measured at the AWOS around 4:10 PM EST. The tornado crossed Bee Line Highway/SR 710 where tree damage was observed, then entered Jupiter Farms where EF-1 to EF-2 damage was noted to trees, outbuildings, and power poles. Footage from a Florida Turnpike highway camera showed the tornado moving north past Jupiter Farms to the Martin County line, where it continued north for a short distance. The tornado was rated a EF-3 with a path width of 200-300 yards for much of the track, with only a few places where the circulation may have briefly lifted.

The environment recovered producing fuel for more severe storms, starting with supercells 1800-2100CST with a line of storms moving east-southeastward across the entire Quad State after 1900CST, crossing through by midnight. Across the Quad State, this event produced the record for most tornado track miles in a single day in office history, along with the second most warnings issued in a day (just behind the May 8, 2024 event).

The first was a long-track EF-2 tornado beginning in Oregon County, then crossed the entirety of Ripley County before lifting on the SW side of Poplar Bluff. A destructive downburst in Dexter transitioned into an EF-2 tornado that tracked northeastward to southeast of Morley in Scott County. An EF-3 tornado that began in far eastern Stoddard County moved northeastward through Sikeston to Diehlstadt with widespread damage in Sikeston.

These heavy rains resulted in widespread flash flooding and eventually led to moderate to major river flooding, with some river gauge sites establishing new record crests as a result.|Prior to landfall, at least a dozen tornadoes impacted west central and southwest Florida as outer rainbands moved across the area, establishing a new record number of tornadoes to affect the area in a 24-hour period.

From there, numerous other buildings downtown had at least some form of roof damage, with debris strewn to the north-northeast one to two blocks, between the intersections of Washington and Market Streets along Marion Street. Though the Limestone County Courthouse thankfully didn't sustain any damage other than their weathervane on the dome of the roof being bent, the very large oak tree beside the staircase wasn't as fortunate; the 100-year old tree was uprooted. From here, the tornado caused major damage just north-northeast at the Veterans Memorial Park, downing iron fencing and hurling a helicopter that was anchored to a metal pole about 50-60 feet to the west. The worst-looking building damage occurred at the intersection of Monroe and Pryor Streets, where an old warehouse was completely destroyed. It was determined that no anchor bolts were noted along the base of the cinderblock walls of the warehouse with the exception of some rebar that was found near where the overhead doors were located.

Widespread significant structural and tree damage resulted from the strong winds, leading to numerous power outages that saw a peak of over 3.5 million customers without power. |Official storm surge measured by tidal gauges ranged from around 5 to 7 feet above normally dry ground in Sarasota, Charlotte and Lee counties, south of where the center moved ashore; however, peak water levels were estimated to have reached up to 10 feet above normally dry ground per NWS storm surveys following the storm, with numerous homes and structures damaged or destroyed by the storm surge across coastal Sarasota, Charlotte and Lee counties. Offshore winds north of Milton's center produced blowout tide conditions resulting in lower than normal water levels, which occurred from around Tampa Bay extending northward across coastal Nature Coast locations.|Milton produced a widespread swath of heavy rainfall just north of its track across the peninsula, with maximum storm totals of generally 12 to 18 inches and some local totals in excess of 20 inches, spanning from the Tampa Bay area north and east into parts of Pasco, Polk and Sumter counties. These heavy rains resulted in widespread flash flooding and eventually led to moderate to major river flooding, with some river gauge sites establishing new record crests as a result.|Prior to landfall, at least a dozen tornadoes impacted west central and southwest Florida as outer rainbands moved across the area, establishing a new record number of tornadoes to affect the area in a 24-hour period. The strongest of these tornadoes were two EF-2 tornadoes, one that tracked through the Fort Myers area, and another that tracked across the Lake Placid area. While the tornadoes were responsible for structural and agricultural damage, only an injury was reported.|Milton's overall impacts across the western Florida peninsula resulted in 7 direct fatalities, 4 indirect fatalities, and over $3 billion in insured losses. Over 200 homes were destroyed, with over 2,000 suffering major damage, and 5,000 suffering minor damage. Over 400 businesses were impacted by Milton.","Tornado damage was first observed near the intersection of County|Rd 731 and Alphonso Lane, where several hardwood oaks had large|branches snapped along with a home with roof and garage damage.|The track continued north along Alphonso Lane producing roof|damage to an additional home and shed, while snapping several|pine trees and uprooting a few palm trees.

This front separated a warm and humid air mass to its north from a warmer and more-humid air mass to its south. A line of multicell thunderstorms persisted southeastward across Mahoning County during the early afternoon and produced localized straight-line convective wind damage. During the late afternoon through early evening, a line of multicell thunderstorms moving eastward across northwest OH merged with a separate line of multicell thunderstorms moving southeastward across western and central Lake Erie.

Throughout the day and into the evening, multiple tornadoes were reported across the region, leading to significant structural damage, particularly in parts of southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. In addition to tornadoes, these storms produced straight-line winds exceeding 70 mph, causing widespread power outages and hazardous conditions on both land and coastal waters. The severe weather threat persisted into the night as the storm system continued its eastward progression.","EF-1 tornado with winds of 90 mph and a maximum width of 50 yards touched down at the intersection of Transmitter Rd. and Clesi Ave. where a few small softwood pine trees were snapped. The tornado travelled to the east on the south side of Clesi Ave. and directly impacted a single wide mobile home. The back porch of the mobile home was removed and this caused the metal roof covering to partially fail. The roof covering was tossed to the north and north-east with some of the roof landing approximately 100 yards to the east-northeast in a neighbors yard. the mobile was properly strapped in, but still shifted about 3 inches on the concrete piers. A window was also broken on the south facing side of the house and all of the skirting was removed. A tree was snapped and pointing to the WSW in the yard. The snapped tree also broke a power pole that was the yard and served as the power connection for the home. A snapped tree was observed in the neighbors back yard pointing to the ESE. Tree damage was observed in the woods at the end of Clesi Ave. in the form of broken off branches. The tornado then travelled through a wooded area before encountering Pine Ridge Rd.

The front worked with sufficient instability aloft to bring strong wind gusts to the surface, with several in the 45 to 60 MPH range according to various observations.

Helene continued to strengthen and became a major hurricane as it moved to the north-northeast across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Helene made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida in the late evening hours of September 26 as a category 4 hurricane. Once inland, Helene moved quickly northward through the state of Georgia and produced widespread significant impacts across multiple states. ||The very large wind field associated with Helen produced widespread tropical storm force winds across southeast South Carolina during the evening and overnight hours of September 26-27.  The peak observed wind gust in southeast South Carolina was 75 mph at the Beaufort Marine Corps Air Station (KNBC).  Wind impacts due to Helene were significant including widespread tree damage and power outages with several counties reporting near 100 percent power outages.  Conditions along the east side of the track of Helene were very conducive to tropical tornadoes, and 8 tornadoes were confirmed across southeast South Carolina.  Fortunately, there were no injuries or fatalities due to the tornadoes or strong winds associated with Helene.  |Helene also produced heavy rainfall across southeast South Carolina.  Rainfall amounts ranged from 2-5 inches in most areas, with the heaviest swath of rain occurring across Jasper, Hampton, Allendale, and Colleton counties where amounts were more on the order of 5-8 inches.  However, no significant flooding or flash flooding was observed due to heavy rainfall.  ||Helene did produce modest storm surge along the southeast South Carolina coast, resulting in a peak observed tide level of 2.26 ft MHHW (8.02 ft MLLW) at the Charleston Harbor National Ocean Service (NOS) tide gage.","A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed that a brief EF-0 tornado with estimated peak winds of 70 mph and associated with an outer rain band of Helene, touched down near Savannah Highway near Davison Road where it caused two power poles to lean.

Helene continued to strengthen and became a major hurricane as it moved to the north-northeast across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Helene made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida in the late evening hours of September 26 as a category 4 hurricane. Once inland, Helene moved quickly northward through the state of Georgia and produced widespread significant impacts across multiple states. ||The very large wind field associated with Helen produced widespread tropical storm force winds across southeast South Carolina during the evening and overnight hours of September 26-27.  The peak observed wind gust in southeast South Carolina was 75 mph at the Beaufort Marine Corps Air Station (KNBC).  Wind impacts due to Helene were significant including widespread tree damage and power outages with several counties reporting near 100 percent power outages.  Conditions along the east side of the track of Helene were very conducive to tropical tornadoes, and 8 tornadoes were confirmed across southeast South Carolina.  Fortunately, there were no injuries or fatalities due to the tornadoes or strong winds associated with Helene.  |Helene also produced heavy rainfall across southeast South Carolina.  Rainfall amounts ranged from 2-5 inches in most areas, with the heaviest swath of rain occurring across Jasper, Hampton, Allendale, and Colleton counties where amounts were more on the order of 5-8 inches.  However, no significant flooding or flash flooding was observed due to heavy rainfall.  ||Helene did produce modest storm surge along the southeast South Carolina coast, resulting in a peak observed tide level of 2.26 ft MHHW (8.02 ft MLLW) at the Charleston Harbor National Ocean Service (NOS) tide gage.","A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed that an EF-0 tornado with estimated peak winds of 80 mph and associated with an outer band of Hurricane Helene, started on Daufuskie Island near Driftwood Cottage Lane. The tornado then continued northward across Daufuskie Island, snapping trees on Stoddard Court and on Martinangel Lane near Captain Monroe Lane. The tornado then crossed over the marsh between Daufuskie Island and Palmetto Bluff. Trees were snapped between Corley Street and Maritime Road near Old Moreland Road.
